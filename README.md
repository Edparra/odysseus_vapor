#Overview
We created a site using ruby on rails  for a Vape shop owned by a friend. This idea was to make a way for customers to check out the items and see what is in stock. Also,users can get a discount for signing up and making a wishlist. In the future, we can convert the wishlist into a shopping cart where users will be able to find and buy items straight from the online store.
